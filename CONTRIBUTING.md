# Contributing

So you want to help? That's great! 

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Clone the repository to your local device
3. Create a branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Process

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Commit your changes following our [commit message conventions](#commit-message-guidelines)
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Code Style

- Follow existing code style
- Use meaningful variable/function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow conventional commit messages. The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. Detailed info: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types include:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code
- refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR description clearly describes the problem and solution
2. Update the README.md if needed
3. Make sure all tests pass (if any)
4. Get at least one review from a maintainer
5. Your PR will be merged once approved
